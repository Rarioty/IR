  abstract =	"Linear algebra algorithms commonly encapsulate
		 parallelism in Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).
		 This solution relies on the fork-join model of parallel
		 execution, which may result in suboptimal performance
		 on current and future generations of multi-core
		 processors. To overcome the shortcomings of this
		 approach a pipelined model of parallel execution is
		 presented, and the idea of the look ahead is utilized
		 in order to suppress the negative effects of sequential
		 formulation of the algorithms. Application to one-sided
		 matrix factorizations, LU, Cholesky and QR, is
		 described. Shared memory implementation using POSIX
		 threads is presented.",
